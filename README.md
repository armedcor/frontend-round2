# **Cormac Lawlor Operatic Baritone**

User-Centric Frontend Developent Project - Code Institute June 2019

This is my professional website to be presented to prospective employees in the operatic world. The Website highlights some of my career achievements to date including awards and prizes that I have received. It also includes some performance photographs along with some recordings to listen to.

## UX

My primary goal when I designed this website was to provide potential employers in the Arts world with a very brief and concise overview of my achievements to date within the operatic world.  I went with a single page scrolling website to allow users to access all information as easily as possible while reducing the need to move through separate pages.

I attempted to create a more minimalist design to give the website a very modern feel while removing any unnecessary content and button clicking. At the bottom of the page I provided links to my Linkedin and Facebook page and also a downloadable PDF version of my CV for employers.

## Technologies

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Bootstrap (4.3)
4 JQuery

## Features

The site has smooth scrolling implemented to allow a smooth transition to each nav link. The collapsed mobile nav bar also features a piece of JQuery script to allow it auto close once a user has clicked on a link improving the UX.

## Features to Implement
